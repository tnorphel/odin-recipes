    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I am sure many of you have already heard about Momo. It's a pretty famous dish served in many restaurants. 
        Momos are basically steamed or fried dumplings which are stuffed with either vegetables or meat.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Refined flour.</li>
        <li>Green cabbages</li>
        <li>Carrots</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Spinach</li>
        <li>Cheese curd (optional)</li>
        <li>Unsalted butter (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper, cumin powder, coriander powder</li>
        <li>Cooking oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Knead the dough. No need to add anything before kneading. Set it aside.</li>
        <li>Finely mince all the vegetables: cabbage, carrots, onions, and spinach.</li>
        <li>In a deep pan, heat a few teaspoons of cooking oil over low to medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the mixture of minced vegetables, cheese curd, and 2 or 3 small cubes of unsalted butter.</li>
        <li>Add salt and the spices.</li>
        <li>Cook over low heat until semi-cooked.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough over a flat surface. Take a steel glass (a circular object with sharp edge will also do),
            and cut circular pieces.
        </li>
        <li>Add a spoon of the mixed vegetable and wrap it. Please watch a video on ways to wrap.</li>
        <li>Cook the momos in a steamer.</li>
        <li>Serve with a home-made chutney, pickle, or tomato ketchup.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you want to try non-vegetarian, replace the vegetables(excluding onions) with finely minced mutton/chicken/pork/beef. 
        Also there is no need to cook the meat onion mixture. Also, no need to add cheese curd and butter.
        Rest of the procedures are same.</p>
