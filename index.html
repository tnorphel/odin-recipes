        <p>Ladakh is a cold desert region situated in the northernmost corner of India. 
            Ladakh has a very harsh climate where temperature can range from -25 to 35 degree celsius. <br>
            The region receives very low precipitation due to it being a rain shadow area. Therefore, the 
            variety of food that grows here is very limited. 
        </p>
        <p>It shares a rich cultural heritage, tradition and history with Tibet. 
            Staple food of Ladakh is Barley. 
            However, nowadays rice, which is imported from other states of India, is consumed by majority of the households.
